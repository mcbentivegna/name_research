# name_research
I've always found naming practices facinating, and I decided to play around with name datasets while trying to teach myself pandas and matplotlib

name_chart_generator: 

The purpose of this little script is to generate a chart that compares the frequency of names in a particular state over time. This will work best with the name data sets generated by state by the SSA  (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). 

While many prefer to work with national datasets, I find state-level data sets to be more instructive, since naming practices vary widely across the US. For example, Massachusetts, where I live, has a much higher frequency of Irish names (i.e. Fiona, Connor) than the rest of the country.

You can see examples of the charts produced in the github repository.
